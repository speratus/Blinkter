Blinkter Community Covenant
===========================
**IMPORTANT:** by joining the Discord or Gitter community or contributing to the codebase via Github, you agree to abide
by the following rules.

A. Rules
-----

1. You shall show respect to every member of whichever community you join.

   Showing Respect includes but is not limited to:

   a. You shall not insult any person for any reason.
   b. You shall not use any kind of derogatory name or label for any member of the community.


2. You shall not use sexual language of any kind. This applies in the broadest possible sense: if something you are
   considering posting *could be* construed as sexual language or a sexual reference, do not post it. Additionally, you
   shall not post pictures of, videos of, or links to anything that is not safe for work (NSFW).

   Violations of this rule may result in a permanent ban without prior notice or a warning of any kind.

3. Recognize that the ability to communicate with members of the community is granted to you as a privilege and
   not a right. Do not abuse that privilege. In other words, do not advertise for anything, send spam, or engage in any
   other activity which is outside the scope of the community.

B. Reporting Violations
--------------------
If you find that a member of the community has violated these rules, you may report such a violation by sending a
direct message to a moderator on either of the above mentioned platforms.

A violation report must include the following:

1. A description of the violation along with the username of the violator.
2. If possible, a screen shot of the offending message or comment. This will aid me in determining whether a violation
   has occurred.

C. Enforcement Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If a violation is reported a moderator, the moderator will take the following steps:

1. He/she will take all reasonable steps to ascertain the veracity of the report.
2. He/she will notify the alleged violator that they have been reported for a violation of the rules. The alleged violator
   is then free to defend their behavior. The moderator will take in to consideration the claims of the alleged violator
   when assessing the veracity of the violation report.
3. Except where otherwise noted, if the report is found to be true, and this is a first time violation, the moderator
   will issue a warning to the violator.

   a. If the violator has received two warnings, the violator may be banned. The alleged violator will be issued no more
      than three (3) warnings. Upon a fourth violation, the violator will be banned, and although a moderator may inform
      the violator of my decision, moderators are under no obligation to do so.

4. If the the veracity of the report cannot be ascertained, the moderator will issue a warning to the violator informing
   them that they have been reported for violating the rules.
5. If a member of the community repeatedly reports another member or members and the veracity of their reports cannot be
   determined, then the reporting member will receive a warning that they are in violation of the rules. (In other words,
   don't report someone because you don't like them. You will be banned for doing so.)

ALL ENFORCEMENT DECISIONS ARE AT THE DISCRETION OF THE MODERATORS OF THESE COMMUNITIES. ALL DECISIONS ARE FINAL AND
MODERATORS ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO EXPLAIN OR JUSTIFY THEIR DECISIONS TO THOSE FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE RULES OR THOSE WHO
REPORT VIOLATIONS OF THE RULES.

IN MAKING ENFORCEMENT DECISIONS, MODERATORS WILL ENSURE THAT BOTH THE ALLEGED VIOLATOR AND THE VIOLATION REPORTER SHALL
RECEIVE FAIR CONSIDERATION BEFORE MAKING A DECISION.

D. Changes to these Policies
-------------------------
At some point, community leadership may opt to make changes to these rules or the enforcement process.

In the event that the rules change, they will be listed here in addition to the communities.

In the event that the rules change, the changes shall apply to all existing community members.
